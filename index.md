### CPSC 120

- Lab 10

  Lab 10 was one of my favorites because I made a calculator. It was just
  a simple project that I found fun to create. The lab also taught me how to
  make 2D vectors using Caliornia counties which I thought was very
  interesting.

- Lab 7

  Lab 7 was another one of my favorites because it took a project that we
  already did, the Hi-Lo game and blackjack, and reintroduced it using
  a new concept. It helped teach me how to use loop statements.

- Lab 5

  Lab 5 is also a favorite of mine because it was one of the first labs to
  use the arguments.at() command. Using this command, we were able to create
  a mad lib as well as a game of blackjack which I found to be very fun.
